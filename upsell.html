			<div class="block_breakthrough">
				Turns back the clock on memory loss In a breakthrough study, researchers were amazed to discover that PS can literally turn back the clock on brain aging—by an amazing 12 years! That means a 64-year-old taking PS can reverse 12 years of memory loss…giving them back the brain they had at 52.<br><br>
				Researchers also found that subjects learned new information faster and recalled information better, too. Imagine never having to struggle to remember someone’s name again!
