				<p>The intake for an otherwise healthy person to have a reasonable chance of avoiding a common cold is in the region of 8-10 grams (8,000-10,000 mg) a day. This is about ten times what corporate medicine has tested in their trials on vitamin C and the common cold</p>
				<p>Ten grams (10,000 mg) is the minimum pharmacological intake; it may help if you have a slight sore throat but more(much more) may be needed</p>
				<p>To get rid of a common cold, you may need anything form 20 to 60 grams (60,000 mg) a day</p>

			<h2>According to WEBMD: <span>The Benefits of Vitamin C.</span> What can vitamin C do for your health?</h2>
			<span>1. Stress.</span> "A recent meta-analysis showed vitamin C was beneficial to individuals whose immune system was weakened due to stress -- a condition which is very common in our society," says Moyad. And, he adds, "because vitamin C is one of the nutrients sensitive to stress, and [is] the first nutrient to be depleted in alcoholics, smokers, and obese individuals, it makes it an ideal marker for overall health."<br><br>
			<span>2. Colds.</span> When it comes to the common cold, vitamin C may not be a cure. But some studies show that it may help prevent more serious complications. "There is good evidence taking vitamin C for colds and flu can reduce the risk of developing further complications, such as pneumonia and lung infections," says Moyad.<br><br>
			<span>3. Stroke.</span> Although research has been conflicting, one study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that those with the highest concentrations of vitamin C in their blood were associated with 42% lower stroke risk than those with the lowest concentrations. The reasons for this are not completely clear. But what is clear is that people who eat plenty of fruits and vegetables have higher blood levels of vitamin C.<br><br>
			<span>4. Skin Aging.</span> Vitamin C affects cells on the inside and outside of the body. A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition examined links between nutrient intakes and skin aging in 4,025 women aged 40-74. It found that higher vitamin C intakes were associated with a lower likelihood of a wrinkled appearance, dryness of the skin, and a better skin-aging appearance.<br><br>
			Other studies have suggested that vitamin C may also:<br><br>
			<ul class="ul">
				<li>Improve macular degeneration*</li>
				<li>Reduce inflammation*</li>
				<li>Reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease*</li>
			</ul>

			<h2><span>Enzyme Labs</span> teamed up with scientists who designed this formula to help deliver the right amounts of Vitamin-C in the most absorbable form</h2>
			Take too much of a high dose of vitamin C it decreases the life of the Vitamin C in your body!!<br><br>
			But if you take the right form of Vitamin C your body will absorb it much quicker increasing the life of the Vitamin C in your body!! Your body is even absorbing Vitamin C in your gut storing it to use as a reserve.<br><br>
			This will help keep your body in a reduced (Anti-Oxidant State) using high doses of the right form of Vitamin C.<br><br>
			The effectiveness of vitamin C is not directly proportional to the dose, but how much your body absorbs and stores. There is a threshold above which vitamin C becomes highly effective. Below this level, the effect is small; above it, the effect is dramatic.
